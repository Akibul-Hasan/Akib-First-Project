            Life is there on the road, not here inside of your room. Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of
            Bengal,
            is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery and many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna
            rivers create fertile plains, and travel by boat is common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an
            enormous
            mangrove forest shared with Eastern India, is home to the royal Bengal tiger.</p>
